Hello, I'm Koh Jin-young, currently in the IT Intelligence and Information Engineering Department at Chonbuk National University.

In order to cultivate talents who will lead the era of digital transformation and the 4th industrial revolution, our department defined the 9 core competencies, 5C-GIANT, by actively reflecting the world standard curriculum and industrial demand in computer science. Based on this, we majored in AI, IoT, cloud/big data, and blockchain/information protection
